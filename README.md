# Snake
*A remake of the classic game, "Snake", with a GUI*

**About Snake:**

* The game begins when one of the 4 arrow keys are pressed
* Initially, the snake has a length of 1 and will be still until the game begins
* Each piece of food that is eaten will increase the snake's length by 1 and increase its speed by a small amount
* The game ends when the snake hits one of the 4 walls or hits its own body
